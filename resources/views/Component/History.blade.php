                        The journey of GCW Hostel began with a vision to provide a safe, secure, and nurturing environment specifically designed for female students and professionals in the heart of Gujranwala.

                        As etched into the heritage of our walls, the foundation of this institution was formally laid on July 2, 1980. This significant milestone in women's education in the region was inaugurated by Sardar Muhammad Aslam Sukhera, who served as the Deputy Commissioner of Gujranwala at that time.

                    <p>
                        From its humble beginnings as a single residential block, the hostel has grown into a premier living space. It offers modern facilities like 24-hour Free WiFi, CCTV security, and lush green lawns, all while maintaining the dignity and traditions established over four decades ago.
